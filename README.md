# About

This app is just a personal project for tracking my workout activity on something that is not an excel sheet. It ~~uses~~ used Next.js/Prisma/Graphql/MUI. It now uses Next.js/Prisma/Trpc/Tailwind. 

Graphql was swapped out ofr trpc becuase it simiplified alot the reasons i was using graphql which was for a nice typed DX from my backend to my frontend. 

Mui was far too big of a package, it and its dependancies were the bulk of my bundle. Maybe if i had a bigger application/website it would make more sense, but i can just as quickly create decent looking pages with tailwind which has the benefit of being mostly straight css/js.

I'm using this as a way to learn new technologies and to have a place to track my workouts.
