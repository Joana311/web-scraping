Throughout movement, keep body straight and maintain tight grip on belt against back of mid-head throughout movement. Use neck to pull belt rather than allowing hand to assist. Clamping belt higher up further from base of skull will permit torque throughout fuller range of motion, particularly range of motion nearer full flexion.",

Elbows should be positioned directly lateral to shoulders at highest position throughout movement. Executing exercise with elbows dropping lower than shoulders is not sufficient position to target rear deltoids. A more upright position (ie: lighter resistance) is required than what is used on Suspended Row for General Back. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright.",

Bar is brought downward anywhere between chin and upper chest. As to minimize shoulder involvement, keep elbows up, allowing elbow to fold upon itself. Range of motion is determined by muscle mass of forearm and biceps. After mastering form and gradually progressing in resistance, push barbell upward more rapidly for greater power development.",

If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Full range of motion through lower back will vary from person to person. For even greater hip and low back articulation, hips may be slid back further with knees straighter.

Hamstrings seemingly acts as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only slightly, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Apart from Sartorius involvement, flexion of hips is largely passive and is accomplished by eccentric contraction of glutes during concentric contraction of hamstrings.",

On most popular suspension trainers, keep lower body weight equally distributed on each side to prevent slippage. Some makes of suspension trainers do not have this slack in their design, so one leg can relax momentarily in straight position, while bent side bears most of resistance, allowing for a more dynamic contraction in this specific movement.",

Positioned handles so back is slightly above floor once grip is established. Keep low back straight, maintaining approximate height from floor throughout movement. Hamstrings seemingly acts as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only about 50%, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement.",
