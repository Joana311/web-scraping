Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion.Â If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.

Begin with light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch. Full range of motion through lower back will vary from person to person. For even greater hip and low back articulation, hips may be slid back further with knees straighter.

If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.",

Secondary levers compensate somewhat for variations if alignment between points of rotation (lever fulcrum and shoulder girdle articulation). Under greater resistance, height of platform can be increased so torso can be positioned at lower angle downward (by bending over at hips). This will allow upper body weight to counterbalance upward pull of levers. See Lever Seated Iron Cross Fly and Lever Iron Cross for Lats.",

Before initiation of movement, lift lever into lower starting position with elbows positioned slightly low. Once first rep is performed, position elbows slightly further out to sides. At bottom position of each rep, lower levers only as far back to allowÂ slight stretch to be felt in chest or shoulders.

Obliques and Rectus Abdominis only contract dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. Conversely, rotation of spine occurs perpendicular to line force (ie: gravity). It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, as in Leg-hip Raise where knees travel to height of shoulders. Also known as Hanging Twisting Knee Raise. Exercise can be performed with ab straps. Also see Spot Reduction Myth and Lower Ab Myth.",

Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward. Incidentally if knee were straight during external rotation of thigh, foot would move outward.",

Hamstrings seemingly acts as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only slightly, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Apart from Sartorius involvement, flexion of hips is largely passive and is accomplished by eccentric contraction of glutes during concentric contraction of hamstrings.",

On most popular suspension trainers, keep lower body weight equally distributed on each side to prevent slippage. Some makes of suspension trainers do not have this slack in their design, so one leg can relax momentarily in straight position, while bent side bears most of resistance, allowing for a more dynamic contraction in this specific movement.",

Other models can be adjusted, so strap on lower leg is slightly longer than strap on upper leg.Â Alternatively, see alternative positioningÂ with one foot can be positioned behind other with only feet being placed in stirrups.
