// first populate an initial set of exercises from the server say 100.
// then when the user searches, send a query to the server to perform the search
// at the same time, filter the exercises in the store and set them to filteredExercises
// when the fetch returns, add these exercises to the total set of exercises as well as the filtered set
// need to make sure that duplicates aren't added. perhaps use a map (id -> exercise).
// **maybe** -- or just keep a copy of the id and fetch exercises data
